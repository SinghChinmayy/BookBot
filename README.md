# BookBot

BookBot is a simple command-line tool to analyze the text of a book.

## Features

*   Calculates the total word count of a book.
*   Provides a count of each character in the book.
*   Generates a report with the analysis.

## Usage

To use BookBot, run the `main.py` script from the command line and provide the path to the book file you want to analyze:
